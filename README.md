# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App, providing a seamless way to start developing your React applications.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  
The page will automatically reload when you make changes, and you may see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
Refer to the documentation for more information about running tests.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production in the `build` folder.  
This command correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified, and filenames include hashes. Your app is now ready for deployment!

### `npm run eject`

> **Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you need to customize the build tool and configuration, you can eject at any time. This command removes the single build dependency from your project and copies all configuration files and transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project, giving you full control. All commands except eject will still work but will point to the copied scripts, allowing you to make adjustments as needed.

You donâ€™t have to use eject unless you want to. The curated feature set is suitable for small to medium deployments.
